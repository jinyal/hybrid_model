## Improving Cascade Reservoir Inflow Forecasting and Extracting Insights by Decomposing the Physical Process Using a Hybrid Model
![Figure 3](https://github.com/jinyal/hybrid_model/assets/59593913/cf56f6a6-d52c-4e40-a3ba-400d9bd250d5)
This repository contains codes to build the hybrid model which decomposes inflow into precipitation-runoff and routing processes to simulate the reservoir inflow in the Missouri River Basin - Mainstem System.Reservoirs.

If you have any questions or ideas regards to the code, feel free to contact Jinyang Li through email at: jinyal4@uci.edu
